Document 7: Supervised Learning for Fraud Detection
Supervised learning is a prevalent machine learning technique where models are trained on labeled datasets. 
In this context, labeled data consists of input features paired with their corresponding output labels, allowing the model to learn the relationship between them. 
One of the most significant applications of supervised learning is in fraud detection, particularly in the financial sector. 
Here, algorithms are trained on historical transaction data, with transactions marked as either fraudulent or legitimate. 
The model learns to recognize patterns associated with fraudulent activities, enabling it to identify potentially suspicious transactions in real-time. 
As financial institutions increasingly turn to automated systems to combat fraud, supervised learning models are becoming more sophisticated, employing techniques such as ensemble learning and anomaly detection to enhance their accuracy. 
By continuously updating these models with new data, organizations can stay one step ahead of emerging fraud tactics and protect their customers more effectively.
