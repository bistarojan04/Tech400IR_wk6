Document 14: AI in Cybersecurity
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is playing a crucial role in enhancing cybersecurity measures across various industries. 
With the rise of sophisticated cyber threats, traditional security methods are no longer sufficient to protect sensitive data and systems. 
AI technologies can analyze vast amounts of network data in real-time, identifying anomalies and potential threats that may go unnoticed by human analysts. 
Machine learning algorithms learn from historical attack patterns, allowing organizations to proactively defend against emerging threats. 
AI-powered security systems can automate responses to detected incidents, minimizing damage and improving response times. 
Additionally, AI assists in fraud detection and prevention, analyzing user behavior to identify suspicious activities. 
As cyber threats continue to evolve, AI will be integral to developing advanced security solutions that safeguard information and maintain trust in digital systems.
