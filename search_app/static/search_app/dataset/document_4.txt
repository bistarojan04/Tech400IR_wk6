Document 4: Natural Language Processing and Chatbots
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a vital component of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. 
By enabling machines to understand, interpret, and generate text, NLP is paving the way for significant advancements in human-computer interaction. 
One of the most prominent applications of NLP is in the development of chatbots, which serve as virtual assistants capable of carrying on conversations with users. 
These chatbots are designed to provide customer support, answer queries, and even facilitate transactions, all while learning from user interactions to improve their responses over time. 
Advanced NLP models like BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) have dramatically improved the capabilities of chatbots, allowing them to comprehend context and generate human-like responses. 
The continuous improvement in NLP technologies is revolutionizing industries such as customer service, healthcare, and education, where conversational agents are used to enhance user engagement and streamline processes. 
As NLP continues to advance, its potential applications in enhancing communication between humans and machines are virtually limitless.
