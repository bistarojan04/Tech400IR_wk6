Document 23: AI in Smart Cities
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is at the forefront of the development of smart cities, enhancing urban living through data-driven solutions. 
AI technologies optimize various aspects of city management, including traffic control, waste management, and energy consumption. 
Smart traffic systems use AI to analyze real-time data, improving traffic flow and reducing congestion. 
AI-powered waste management systems predict collection needs, optimizing routes and reducing costs. 
Moreover, AI enhances public safety through surveillance systems that can detect unusual patterns or behaviors, alerting authorities to potential threats. 
As cities become more interconnected, AI will play a crucial role in improving quality of life for residents while promoting sustainability and efficiency. 
The future of urban living is set to be transformed by AI innovations, fostering smarter, safer, and more efficient cities for all.
