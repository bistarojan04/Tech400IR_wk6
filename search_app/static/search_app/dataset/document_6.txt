Document 6: Computer Vision in Autonomous Vehicles
Computer vision is a critical technology in the development of autonomous vehicles, enabling them to perceive and interpret their surroundings. 
Through the use of sensors, cameras, and advanced algorithms, autonomous vehicles can gather visual data and make informed decisions based on this information. 
For instance, computer vision systems identify road signs, detect obstacles, and recognize pedestrians, allowing vehicles to navigate safely in real time. 
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are often employed in these applications, processing visual data to extract relevant features and make predictions. 
The ability to analyze images and videos in real time is crucial for ensuring the safety and efficiency of autonomous driving systems. 
As technology progresses, the integration of computer vision with other sensors, such as LIDAR and radar, will enhance the capabilities of self-driving cars, making them more reliable and effective on the road. 
This technological evolution is poised to transform the automotive industry, leading to safer and more efficient transportation solutions.
