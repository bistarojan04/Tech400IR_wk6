Document 9: Decision Trees in Predictive Analytics
Decision trees are a widely used machine learning algorithm in predictive analytics, characterized by their intuitive structure resembling a tree. 
These models work by recursively splitting the dataset into subsets based on the most significant features, ultimately leading to predictions at the leaves of the tree. 
Decision trees are particularly popular due to their interpretability, allowing users to understand the decision-making process of the model. 
They can be used for both classification and regression tasks, making them versatile tools for various applications. 
In fields such as finance, decision trees can assess credit risk by analyzing customer data to predict defaults. 
In healthcare, they can help classify patient diagnoses based on symptoms and medical history. 
While decision trees are powerful, they can be prone to overfitting, especially when trained on complex datasets. 
To mitigate this, techniques such as pruning and ensemble methods like Random Forests are often employed, enhancing the model's robustness and predictive power.
