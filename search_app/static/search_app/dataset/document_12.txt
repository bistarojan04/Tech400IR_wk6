Document 12: AI in Agriculture
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming the agricultural sector by improving crop management, pest control, and yield predictions. 
Farmers are increasingly adopting AI technologies to analyze soil conditions, weather patterns, and crop health through advanced sensors and drones. 
These tools provide real-time data that help farmers make informed decisions about irrigation, fertilization, and pest control. 
Machine learning algorithms can predict optimal harvest times by analyzing historical data and current conditions, maximizing crop yield. 
Additionally, AI-driven systems can identify pests and diseases early, enabling targeted interventions that minimize chemical usage and reduce costs. 
As agriculture faces challenges such as climate change and population growth, AI offers innovative solutions that promote sustainable farming practices and enhance food security. 
The integration of AI in agriculture is not just about increasing productivity; it’s about creating smarter, more efficient farming systems that can adapt to changing environmental conditions.
