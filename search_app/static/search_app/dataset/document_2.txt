Document 2: Deep Learning in Image Recognition
Deep learning (DL) is a specialized subset of machine learning that employs neural networks with multiple layers to process data. 
This advanced form of ML has been pivotal in improving image recognition technologies, allowing machines to analyze visual inputs more accurately. 
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a type of deep learning architecture, have been particularly successful in tasks involving image classification and object detection. 
For example, in the medical field, DL algorithms can examine radiological images to detect abnormalities such as tumors, often with greater accuracy than human radiologists. 
In addition to healthcare, DL has found applications in security systems for facial recognition, where algorithms learn to distinguish between various facial features in diverse lighting conditions and angles. 
Moreover, deep learning is integral to the development of autonomous vehicles, enabling them to recognize pedestrians, road signs, and other critical elements in their environment. 
As the availability of large datasets and computational power increases, deep learning continues to push the boundaries of what is possible in image recognition and beyond.
