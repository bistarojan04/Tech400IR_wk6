Document 8: Unsupervised Learning for Customer Segmentation
Unsupervised learning is a machine learning approach where models are trained on data without predefined labels. 
This technique is particularly useful for identifying patterns and structures within datasets, making it valuable for applications such as customer segmentation. 
In this context, businesses utilize unsupervised learning algorithms to group customers based on their purchasing behaviors, preferences, or demographic information. 
By analyzing transaction histories, unsupervised models can identify distinct segments within a customer base, enabling targeted marketing strategies. 
For instance, clustering algorithms like K-means or hierarchical clustering can categorize customers into groups such as frequent buyers, occasional shoppers, or those who abandon carts. 
This segmentation allows companies to tailor their marketing efforts, improve customer satisfaction, and ultimately increase sales. 
As businesses continue to gather vast amounts of data, unsupervised learning will play a crucial role in helping them extract valuable insights and make data-driven decisions.
